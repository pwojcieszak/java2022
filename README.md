# Java2022
## Description

This repository consists of assignments made in the course of the subject "Java" in college in year 2022. 

Tasks were provided to us by the instructor often with partially written code or a general scheme. We had to add missing features to the program.

My instructor's repository with his suggested solutions can be found at this [link](https://gitlab.com/mmozolewski/java2022). I have no way to mark which parts of the code are 100% mine therefore I can only suggest comparing my repository with the one mentioned above.

## Content

Each task is available in a separate branch. 

* lab04-rest - A simple application in spring that pretends to send emails and notifications. It uses the "SenderApplication" model, which I had to implement as part of lab03, which unfortunately I did not save separately. 
* lab05-queue - Priority queue implementation with generic type.
*lab-kolokwium - A simple exercise that is part of a test taken in the middle of the semester.
* lab07-threads1 - "SenderApplication" reworked to send messages in parallel using multiple threads.
* lab08_databases - An application that stores messages to be sent in a database and retrieves those to be sent.
* lab09_sockets01 - An application that simulates a server that sends personalized messages to connected clients.
